# Drawing Assignment 1 - (Creative-Coding)
With this assignment, I set out to create a semi-randomly generated starry
sky.
So first, I put a couple of moons out in a row (which are deleted now), in
order to map a
center for all of the clusters of the stars.
Second, I made the first star cluster is one that randomly spawns the
stars using a
single for loop to spawn it over the whole canvas starting from the main
middle moon.
Then, for each of the moons I made smaller clusters using double for loops
to make a
larger cluster of smaller stars and form a sort of ellipse shape. It was
after this point
that I deleted the original moons because it looked better without it.
After adding all of the clusters of stars, I decided to add a randomized
color, rather than
just white stars. It looks good either way but with the colors it looks
very visually
pleasing to me.
Finally, I added an arc and put a couple more arcs over it to create a
moon as a final touch
the scene.
